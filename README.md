# sv-model

sv_gen is a program that generates double strand breaks and rejoins them
according to non-homologous end joining. Any unconnected break points will
undergo replication at the synthesis phase of the cell cycle, followed by
secondary growth and mitosis.

 abc is the approximate Bayesian Computation program that currently runs sv_gen
 N number of times and compares its output to chromothripsis criteria,
 removing all simulations that are insufficient.
